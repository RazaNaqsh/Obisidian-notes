	- Boolean

- Non Primitive
	- Linear
		- Static

## Types of Algorithms

- Simple Recursive algorithms
	- uses recursion 
- Divide and conquer algorithms
	- Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of same type and solve these recursively
	- Combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
- Dynamic Programming algorithms
	- works based on memoization
	- To find the best solution
- Greedy algorithms
	- Choose a local optimum solution at each step, so that we will end up at global optimum solution
- Brute force algorithms
	- tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
- Randomized algorithm
	- use a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision
