Auxiliary Space : Space that you take to solve the problem
+
Input Space: space you take to store the input


Extra variable = Auxiliary Space


```
a, b
c= a+b

a,b are the input space
c is the extra variable is the auxiliary space

sc = a.s. + i.s.

therefore , O(3) is the space complexity
```

Note:

```
//to save space, never do like the following

a, b

b= a+b

//this does save the space for the third var
but instead we are changing the data we had, this is not accepted .


//NOTE: Never do anything to the input unless the interviewer said.
therefore never ever manipulate the data.


```


Note:

in competitive programming, we send our code to the server which allows us 1s, which is usually 10^8
operations
