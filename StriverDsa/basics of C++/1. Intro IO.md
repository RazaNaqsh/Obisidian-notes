```
#include<iostream>  // for taking input
#include<math.h> // for mathematical task


int main(){
//general skeleton of cpp
std::cout << "Hey" << std:endl; //or you can use \n for a new line

}
```

now using std std in each thing is annoying, 
use namespace std


```
#include<iostream> 
using namespace std;

//now we dont have to write std for cout or endl
```


#### Input

```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int x , y;   // you can take multi var in a single line
	cin >> x >> y; // take output using a single line
	cout << "Value of x:" << x << "and y: " << y;
	return 0
}

```


### IF you want to include every single library that exists in CPP

```
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
```
This does take a lot of time, but its very negligible when you run the program
