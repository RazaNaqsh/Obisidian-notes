the type of data that will get stored in the memory



INT:
```
int x = 10; // only stores number
//range of int is -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
// size of int is 4bytes
//beyond that range we use long 
long y = 15;

//more long
long long z = 1500000;
```



FLOAT/DOUBLE:

```
//decimal like data type
float x = 5.6;
float y = 5; // we can store an integer in float as well
```



STRING:

```
string s;
cin >> s; 
cout << s;
```

```
cin >> s1 >> s2;
cout << s1 << " " << s2;

//here if we write "hey there" as input "hey" will go to s1, and "there" will goto s2;

//but if we want the whole line input to go into a single var we write

string str;
getline(cin, str);
cout<<str;
```



CHAR:
if we want single char stored then we use char

```
char ch = 'a' // note we use single quotes for char 
// and double "a" for strings
```
