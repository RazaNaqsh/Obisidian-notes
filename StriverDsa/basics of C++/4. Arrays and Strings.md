```
int arr[5]

cin>> arr[0] >> arr[1] >> arr[2] >> arr[3] >> arr[4]

cout<<arr[3]

//is mutable
```

Array are stored in a consecutive memory address, but we are not sure where the first one will get stored.




### 2d Array

```
int arr[3][3];

a[1][1] = 10;

```





## String

```
string s = "Striver";
cout << s[2] // prints r, cuz it is 0 based indexing


```
