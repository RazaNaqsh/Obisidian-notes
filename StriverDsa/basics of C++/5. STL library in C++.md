STL in c++ consists of 4 parts:
- Algorithms
- Containers
- functions
- Iterators


### Pair
part of utility library, stores data in pair variable

```
pair<int, int> p = { 1, 2}

cout << p.first << " " << p.second; // way to access the first and the second element

pair<int, pair<int,int>> p  = { 1, { 3,4}} // this is nested pair to store more than 2 variables
cout << p.first << " " << p.second.second << " " << p.second.first;

//array of pairs

pair<int, int> arr[]= {{1,2} , {2,5} , {5,1}}
cout << arr[1].second;



```

### Vector

Vectors are the dynamic array in c++, where you can resize all you want, which is not possible in arrays

```
void explainVector(){

vector<int> v;

v.push_back(1); // adds the element at the back of the vector
v.emplace_back(2); //resizes the vector and adds at the back
//emplace back is better than pushback

vector<pair<int,int>>vec;
v.push_back({1,2}) // we can also create pairs in vectors

v.emplace_back(1,2); // but if we use emplace back we dont have to specify using the curly braces, it automatically assumes that the entered data is a pair

}
```



```
vector<int> v(5,100);
// here we can predefine the vector , we get 5 instances of 100, output is like {100,100,100,100,100}

//if we simply want to declare empty vector of size 5, we do:
vector<int> v(5);


//suppose we want to copy a vector to another we can do

vector<int> v1(5,20); //output: {20,20,20,20,20}
vector<int> v2(v1); // copies the v1, and gives the same output
```


### Iterators 

Using Iterator we can access the vectors as well, 
Lets understand Iterators using vectors

```
vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin();
//declaring iterator, we use ::iterator and name it , anything 

// now when we use v.begin() , it points to the beginning of vector in the memory, 
if we print v.begin(), we print the memory address, 
to access the element we do '*(v.begin())'

or the stuff is getting stored in the 'it', we can print *it
```

So if we do , it++ , the iterator moves to the address of the next value

lets take an example , 
```
{10,20,30,40}
```
iterators :
- .begin(): points at the address of the element 10 {10,20,30,40}
- .end() : points to the address right after the last element in the memory, that is after 40 {10,20,30,40}
- .rend(); assumes that the vector is reversed and, the 10 is the last element, thus rend points after the 10, that is in real before the 10 element. also moves in the reverse way {40,30,20,10}
- .rbegin(): would be pointing to the element 40,with the order being {40,30,20,10}

```
//running the iterator using the loop

for(vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it!= v.end(); it++){
	cout<< *(it) << " ";
}
```
